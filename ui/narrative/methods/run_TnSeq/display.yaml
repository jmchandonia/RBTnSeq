parameters:
  input_read_library :
    ui-name : |
      Read Library Object
    short-hint : |
      Reads from pooled barcode mutants
    long-hint  : |
      The set of reads from the barcode mutant pool that you want to map to the input genome. Reads should be single end.
  input_genome :
    ui-name : |
      Genome object
    short-hint : |
      Genome to map barcode reads to
    long-hint  : |
      The genome of the organism that was subjected to transposon mutagenesis, that you want the reads mapped to.  The genome must already be annotated with genes.
  input_barcode_model :
    ui-name : |
      Barcode model
    short-hint : |
      Which barcode model was used to make the reads?
    long-hint  : |
      The barcode model encodes what barcode sequence reads should look like, showing part of the transposon sequence along with expected locations of the barcode and flanking genomic sequence.  All models included in Morgan Price's FEBA repository are currently supported; we plan to support custom models in the future.
  input_minN :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum number of reads
    short-hint : |
      Minimum number of reads for a mutant to be picked for the pool
    long-hint  : |
      This is the minimum number of barcode reads required for a mutant to be picked for the TnSeq pool.  The default is 5.
  output_mapped_reads :
    ui-name : |
      Output mapped reads
    short-hint : |
      MappedReads object created by this method
    long-hint  : |
      This method will create a MappedReads object indicating where all the barcode insertions map to in your genome.
  output_pool :
    ui-name : |
      Output Pool
    short-hint : |
      Pool object created by this method
    long-hint  : |
      This method will create a Pool (i.e, TnSeq library) object that includes the starting counts for all barcoded mutant strains in the TnSeq experiment.

description : |
  <p>This method runs the first and second steps of Morgan Price's FEBA pipeline for TnSeq processing, mapping barcode reads to a genome and creating a mutant library (Pool) to use in BarSeq experiments.  If you already have mapped your barcode reads to the genome and just want to re-run the second step, use the faster "Make TnSeq Pool" method instead.</p>
