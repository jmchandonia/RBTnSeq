parameters:
  input_mapped_reads :
    ui-name : |
      Input mapped reads
    short-hint : |
      MappedReads object created by the "Run TnSeq" method
    long-hint  : |
      This method needs a MappedReads object indicating where all the barcode insertions map to in your genome.
  input_minN :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum number of reads
    short-hint : |
      Minimum number of reads for a mutant to be picked for the pool
    long-hint  : |
      This is the minimum number of barcode reads required for a mutant to be picked for the TnSeq pool.  The default is 5.
  output_pool :
    ui-name : |
      Output Pool
    short-hint : |
      Pool object created by this method
    long-hint  : |
      This method will create a Pool (i.e, TnSeq library) object that includes the starting counts for all barcoded mutant strains in the TnSeq experiment.

description : |
  <p>This method runs the second step in Morgan Price's FEBA pipeline for TnSeq processing, taking mapping barcode reads that were mapped to a genome, and creating a mutant library (i.e., Pool) to use in BarSeq experiments.  You only need to use this method if you have already run the "Run TnSeq" method and want to re-make your Pool with different parameters.</p>
