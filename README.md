# RBTnSeq
---

This module wraps Morgan Price's RBTnSeq pipeline,
available from https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/feba

Data objects for this SDK module are stored in a
different module, since the SDK can't currently handle
data.  The current version is here:
https://github.com/jmchandonia/rbtn_seq
